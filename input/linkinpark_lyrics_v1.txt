From the top to the bottom (bottom to top I stop)
At the core of the rotten (stop to just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (so bright in the sky)
And I'm far from a wait list (thinking, why did I try?)

<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
From the thread to the needle, middle to end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then, with the eyes tightly shut looking through the rust
And rotten dust, a spot of light floods the floor
Pours itself upon the world of pretend
Then the eyes ease open and it's dark again

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
Moving all around, swinging of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go 'round, the sunset creeps past the
Street lamps, cars, chain-links, and concrete
A window then grows, and captures the eye
Cries out yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top
Nothing stops in this land of the chain
When brains lose not knowing they were part of the game
And then the insides grow, but the box stays the same in shame
Shovel up the pieces to the pain
You can try to hide yourself in the world of pretend
But when the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

The microphone molester, machete undresser
"Stupid-dope-fresh" type shit resurrector
Top gun, Miramar best-of-the-best-er
The leave-an-MC-peace-in-rest-er
Skill tester, the flex-the-gunner
The make-funner, the adversary make runner
The make summer cold with rhymes I spit
Kick gift to lifted delinquent wit
I be prophet, my hand—top it? Stop it
Fly like rocket when I rock it
Lock it down with this perverse verse
Every fuckin' curse a burst of hurt
Move crowds: physical fitness rhymes
Coke heads couldn't do my lines
I'm decorated like Christmas pines
My battalion rocks
MCs become silhouettes of chalk

Losing my pride will save it in many days

Hit the dirt 'cause the words I spit will
Do more than just rip your shirt
I'll bitch slap your soul, contact the track control
You're coming at me? You can't hack it though
So ridiculous, watching my crew get sick with this
Wickedness, pitchin' this, lyrical viciousness
To crews and cliques, made of men and mistresses
This is my life: the twilight and the fight night
And trying to see nothing but the highlights when I write
These eyes on horizons, die for my song, cry rhymes in Krylon
Fire on, move men telekinetically
Esoterically beat-speaking with clarity
Feel my verities, heroism of heresy
And sever every MC I see with severity

Of course you know what a fuse is...
It's a long piece of cord impregnated with gun powder
When you strike a match and light it
It burns, fitfully, spiraling to its end,
At which there is a little surprise

Krypton, short suit MCs you'll be ripped on
You fell off and it's my lyric sheet you just slipped on
Get gone, spit on mic's made in Hong Kong
Rock on, sing songs mightier than King Kong
A Donkey, you think you want me or want this
Want some, hold your reputation for Ransom
With these here, handsomely crafted tactics
To break a snake and see like a cheap profilactic
Galactic, space now yeah that grabs attention
Crack heads nodded like a pest can't even mention
Right a pat traps gas tracks in sections
Kid steps this he need witness protection

Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here
Trying to see what I can't be seeing

It was the junkyard crooked letter C-I-entific
Duck us, the ruckus I'll bring stings your eardrum
Hear one, lalala loose frind me fearsome
Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone
Testing the eight-hundred, eighteenth battalion
Shallow the one who's run like rebels
Enola gay rhymes kicked the notch up a level
In intensity, send back the tax that you sent to me
Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me
MP3 versus R33 MCs, Swiss change your gear putting shrapnel in the breeze
We're MCs with enemy companies with my hand full of lyrics talking 'bout you want these
Please, don't even speak the name of channels and low gadget mic shit put it down like pens
For my friends and my fam let them dodge it around this mic shot through the back of an MCs hand
With the strength that he had a bridge you don't want that close body fields in hand to hand combat
Battle cats, it's like the sectional speech warfare words slash cords
Come deford shots get rid don't question my intention when your butt gets kicked

This is how it's done going for the title and crown
Renowned MCs surround as the beat breaks down
In 2 elements clubbin' up those that bring the best and that's
Am I see the way it ought to be finessed?
Yes

Yes, am I the one to keep you on your toes?
Most definitely in my b-boy pose
It's the electric boogaloo with a slight twist
Touch your chin to your chest to the rhythm like this

Now see what I have, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move
Now see what I had, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move

<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
MCs dogging me since the first day I grabbed the mic
Now it's like: you sit, you stay
Cobra Kai fly styles I'm kicking
Stickin' MCs real quick 'cause time's tickin'

At the drop of the defense, I let loose the venom
Sendin' a shot of verbal heat up in 'em
The ending is done, grab your family and run
Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots at the sun

Record industry rule four-thousand-eighty-one
Question my intentions and your whole world is done
Like Forrest you'll run, turn your eyeballs into Saturn
Full Metal Jacket fully auto-rhyme pattern

She can't hide no matter how hard she tries
Her secret disguised behind the lies
And at night she cries away her pride
With eyes shut tight staring at her inside

All her friends know why she can't sleep at night
All her family asking if she's alright
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell
Well, all she's got to do is stop kidding herself

She can only fool herself for so long <i>[3x]</i>

When it comes to how to live his life he can't be told
Says he's got it all under control
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with
But in reality it'd be a problem to just quit

An addict and he can't hold the reins
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem he's got
But can't get off the carousel until he makes it stop

He can only fool himself for so long <i>[3x]</i>

Yo

Watch as the room rocks
Mentally moonwalk
Mixed media slang
Banging in your boom box verbal violence
Lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip-hop rhymes are childish
You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an MC
With your lack of skill and facility
You're killing me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
You're not an MC if someone else writes your lines
And rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
'Cause rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years
But now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You want to be an MC you've got to study the skill

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up

<i>[Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington:]</i>
So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally you don't have the hip-hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories
Sounding like the only hip-hop you've heard is top 40
And your record company is completely missing it
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate
So in a battle you can't hack it
React with whack shit
And get smacked with verbal back flips
Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It's taken decades for MCs to establish this
You're new to hip-hop and welcome if you're serious
But not on the mic
Leave that to the experienced

Using the waves of sound the true master paralyzes his opponents, leaving him vulnerable to attack

Where should I start
Disjointed heart
I've got no commitment
To my own flesh and blood
Left all alone
Far from my home
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart, I

Keep it locked up inside

Cannot express
To the point I've regressed
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed, I

Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies

It's too late to love me now
You have never shown me
It's too late to love me now
You don't even know me

Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me)

Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance

Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
Cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift
Dog-paddle through a bog of shadows and smog
With my thought catalog, analog, rap battle log
Keep my distance, and fear resistance, hurt by persistence
The twisted web of tangled lies strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes against the state of being, feeling the weightlessness, press me to the ceiling, reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound
Tuned to the frequency making your chest shake with every boom, involuntary muscle contraction
Ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria
The sound pounds to make the dead flush
To hand you a head rush with read rhymes and said stuff

I've been digging into crates ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
Mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I could start blessing it
And chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double helixes and show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumentalness
And all of the MCs that hate us
So try on
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones

I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice

Part of me won't go away
Every day reminded how much I hate it
Weighted against the consequences
Can't live without it so it's senseless
Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with a gaping hole
Take control of my life
And wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
Ya hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, the wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are
And now I'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
I rather not even be than the man that's staring in the mirror through me

Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me

Swallowing me

<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it
Once it's been dealt with you feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know that you can choose to lose
The part in your heart where your insides bruised
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

And rots away silently

This part of me won't go away

Everywhere I look around
I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself

And multiplies 'til you can taste the sun
And burned by the sky you try to take it from
But if it falls, there's no place to run
Crumbling down, it's so unreal

It's so unreal

They're dealing you in to determine your end
And sending you back again, the places you've been
And bending your will 'til it breaks you within

Fill their eyes

And the highlights on a frame of steel

Calling me to be part of their property
And now I see that I get no chance

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
Get no chance
<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
I get no break
Fakes and snakes quickly lead to mistakes
And as the tightrope within
Slowly starts to thin

So, what do you think?

<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
What do I do to ignore what's behind me?
Do I follow my fate and escape blindly?
Do I hide my pride away from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?

Do I let it go and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust none and live life in lonliness?

The sunlight burns the skin of sleeping men
I make the right turns but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade but then
I just end up getting hurt again by myself

It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on

With thoughts of failure sinking in

<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to give in to fate seems senseless
If I hide my pride I lie sleepless
And won't be able to cope with my weakness

If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself

She can't hide no matter how hard she tries
Her secret disguised behind the lies
And at night she cries away her pride
With eyes shut tight staring at her inside

All her friends know why she can't sleep at night
All her family asking if she's alright
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell
Well, all she's got to do is stop kidding herself

An addict and he can't hold the reins
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem he's got
But can't get off the carousel until he makes it stop

Part of me won't go away
Every day reminded how much I hate it
Weighted against the consequences
Can't live without it so it's senseless
Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with a gaping hole
Take control of my life
And wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
Ya hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, the wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are
So tired of making the same mistakes again and again,
It sucks that it just won't end and I can't let myself be,
the man that's staring in the mirror through me

Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me

Swallowing me

<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it
Once it's been dealt with you feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know that you can choose to lose
The part in your heart where your insides bruised
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

Cut myself free willingly

I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself

Where should I start
Disjointed heart
I've got no commitment
To my own flesh and blood
Left all alone
Far from my home
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart, I

Keep it locked up inside

Cannot express
To the point I've regressed
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed, I

Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies

It's too late to love me now
You have never shown me
It's too late to love me now
You don't even know me

Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
Cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift
Dog-paddle through a bog of shadows and smog
With my thought catalog, analog, rap battle log
Keep my distance, and fear resistance, hurt by persistence
The twisted web of tangled lies strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes against the state of being, feeling the weightlessness, press me to the ceiling, reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound
Tuned to the frequency making your chest shake with every boom, involuntary muscle contraction
Ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria
The sound pounds to make the dead flush
To hand you a head rush with read rhymes and said stuff

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today.
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left

I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)

So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)

That the face inside is watching you too
Right inside your skin

I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words: they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts: they make no sense

Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

To the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore

And even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I wanna run away
And open up my mind
I wanna run away
And open up my mind
I wanna run away
And open up my mind
I wanna run away
And open up my mind

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams?
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?

Do I sit here and try to stand it,
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness,
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?

Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade but then
I just end up getting hurt again by myself

<i>[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]</i>

I can't hold on

With thoughts of failure sinking in

<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone

If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself

It starts with one
<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
All I know
<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i> Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
It's so unreal
<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
It's so unreal, didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window

Watch you go

I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one

It makes me think of how you act for me
You do favors and then rapidly
Just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me

I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

<i>[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]</i>
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy,
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
Maybe someday I'll be just like you
And step on people like you do
And run away of the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were

You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now you see how quiet it is, all alone

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

There's a place so dark you can't see the end
Skies cock back and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion

Then with the eyes shut looking through the rust and rotten dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Moving all around
Screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go 'round
And the sunset creeps behind
Street lamps, chain-link and concrete

A little piece of paper with a picture drawn floats
On down the street 'til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

Put a label on how you wake up every morning
And go to bed at night

Hybrid

I've been digging into crates ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I could start blessing it
Chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double helixes and show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumentalness
And all of you MCs who hate us
So you can try on
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones

I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Akira
I put a kink in the backbones of clones
With microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day
Over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon
Technicolor type A

On highways ride with road rage
Cages of wind
And cages of tin
That bounce all around
Surround sound

Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene
Paintings
Overall the same thing

Sing song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension
Combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention

Meant to put you away with the pencil
Pistol, official

Spin rah blah blah blah

Wow that's a new invention
That shit's brand new
We're constantly evolving
It is constantly changing

Sometimes...

There's a lot of change
Everybody's always up with labels
There ain't no label for this shit
They're always gonna try to put a label on it
Try to create something
So they can water it down

<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
When I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold
Trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

<i>[Chester:]</i>
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Hey, yo

All I know, hah, I so-socialize
Like the host of the party
I spoke, shake, and made eye contact
Partied and toast strong, all night
Northeast, Southwest coast
I'm staring out the window
No oppourtunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up to weaken your system
I had you throwing up
I brought you back into things
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
You’d always seem to make it worth it
I pig-skin, I never nerf it
You felt like loving, never played real
I’m bringing the pleasure
By any means it means I’m leaving your team
Hell of a team, man it seems I tried so hard

One thing, I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
'Cause when I designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all, scared to fall, and I hadn't even tried to crawl
But I was forced to run with you mocking me, stopping me, backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now chock-full of hypocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
'Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me

We're stuck in a place so dark
You can hardly see
The manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
And duck away into the darkness
Times up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut so tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open
And it's dark again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care?

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Listen to the sound
Dizzy from the ups and downs
I'm nauseated by the polluted rot that's all around
Watching the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows and captures the eye
And cries out a yellow light as it passes me by
And a young shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rock with antennas on top, now
Nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The sane lose not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change
The box stays the same and the figure inside could bear anybody's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday I'm hoping to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again

Yo, from the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me

I'm here at this podium talking
The ceremonial offerings dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring
What's happening?
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants
Causing urban collapsing
Bullets that scar souls with dark holes
Get more than your car stole, some parts be blacker than charcoal, for real
This society's deprivation depends not on our differences but the separation within
No preparation is made
Limited aid, minimum wage
Living in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspreads like a permanent plague
I'm the forgotten

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Reverse psychology is failing miserably
It's so hard to be left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
There is nothing left but to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking why
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
I want to be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
But the sun doesn't give the light to the moon assuming the moon's going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors then rapidly
You just turn around and start asking me about things that you want back from me

I'm sick of the tension
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I hate when you say you don't understand
You'll see it's not meant to be
I want to be in the energy

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
You'll see it's not meant to be
I want to be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

Two, two, three, three
Yo, yo, yo
Give me Energon to keep me calm
You and your mom keep all the dram
Used to be a team, passed that baton
But you flop that bomb as you drop that bomb
Take it to the john in your Babylon
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on
I don't really give a dang
You pissed on my lawn
Took a dump like a punk
Now the battle's on

So sick of you stressing
Sick of you fessing
Sick of you acting like I owe you some
Find another place
To feed your face
If you don't, we gon' bump
Get it up here, crunk

You try to take the best of me

Wasn't that fun?
Let's try something else

Forty-five caliber killer, but out of the Phila-
-dela thriller show you brothers how you not a guerilla
Smooth talkin', fully automatic weapon concealer
Taste thriller, great fillers, hit 'em with the bounce filler
Filthy stinkin', standin' on solid ground and still be sinkin'
Submergin' in the Parks and still be Linkin
Pluck beef when it starts, but fuck your thinkin'
It's not a mirage
I rip the motherfuckin' track up from out the garage
Where I'm hip to the duck, but it's hard to dodge
In the back of that spine where my darts is lodged
Thought flippin' straight up, rippin' apart your squad
X-Ecutioner style, that cuts and blends
Like a syringe, we bangin' you in each of your limbs
See me comin' through your party hard, without no bodyguard
Smokin' somethin', stompin' on each of your Timbs
I'm the B to the L, the A, the C-King (uh huh..)
And when it comes to plannin' the Thought, keep thinkin' that

Sometime, sometime, sometime, sometime
(Hybrid, Linkin Park)

I've been digging into crates, ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic, so I could start blessin' it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us, but I twist mic cords to
Double helixes and show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalists on all of you emcees who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I fire bomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

(Akira) I put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Sprayin' bright day over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon, technicolor, type A
On highways, write with road rage
Pages of wind and cages of tin that bounce all around
Surround sound, devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene, paintings, overall the same things
Sing-song, karaoke, copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics
Fourth dimension, combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away with the pencil pistol
Official sixteen line the rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spittin' raw blah blah blah, you can say you saw

Who's the man demanding you hand over your Land Rover
No man's bolder than Pharoahe when he jams your plan's over
I inflict sclerosis; the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye's extremely high voltage
That's why I need ruby quartz glasses
'Cause when I glance there's a chance that I might blast the masses
Subliminals, transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated in nano
I use skills when I need, please heed the rhyme I heal
When I bleed when I proceed through time
I walk through walls and inanimate obstacles
By inducing a reduction of cells and molecules
I bring the knowledge, you swallow a steak, that's a hologram
I boxed your head, fattened your lip like Collagen
A telepath, deliver verses with no postage

Hey, Mike, what’s up?
This is Ron, Riff Raff, just asking you what’s happening?
I was just touching base, seeing how your Easter went
Um, just seeing if you’re going to see Joe sometime soon, too,
Because he’s got my keyboard that I’ve been trying to get back
I’ve been trying to call him and he hasn’t been returning any messages
So I’m seeing what the best angle is to, you know, get it back

Come on

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold and the static
And I put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I’m pretending to be where I’m not anymore
A little taste of hipocrisy
And I’m left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you’re so close to me
You’re still so distant
And I can’t bring you back

It’s true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you’re not with me

I’m with you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong
I pretend that the past isn’t real
I’m trapped in this memory
And I’m left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you’re so close to me
You’re still so distant
And I can’t bring you back

It’s true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you’re not with me

I’m with you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No, I won’t let you control my fate
While I’m holding the weight of the world on my conscience
No, I won’t just sit here and wait
While you weighing options
You’re making a fool of me
No, you didn’t dare try to say that you don’t care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
No, it ain’t like me to beg on my knees
Oh, please, oh, baby, please
That’s not how I’m doing things
No, I’m not upset
No, I’m not angry
I know love is love, 
Love and sometimes it pains me
With or without you
I’ll always be with you
You’ll never forget me
I’m keeping you with me
No, I won’t let you take me to the end of my rope
While you burn it and torture my soul
No, I’m not your puppet
And, no, no, no, I won’t let you go

No, no matter how far we’ve come
I can’t wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we’ve come, I
I can’t wait to see tomorrow

With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

Uh, yeah

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here’s not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia’s all I got left
I don’t know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It’s like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
And watches everything
So, know that when it’s time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

It’s like I’m paranoid looking over my back
It’s like a whirlwind inside of my head
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
It’s like a face inside that’s right beneath my skin

Hey, yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn’t real
But in my mind, I find myself in places with names but not faces
My memory races at speeds
Hundred degrees
My soul bleeds, devil must’ve planted the seed
Now it feels like my back’s against the wall
I’m taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody’s responding at all
But I don’t know who I can trust
The screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the frame
All I’m trying to do is just master me
All I want to do is smoke a blast-to-beat
But something keeps talking to me
Consciously, responsibly, keeps haunting me from dusk ’til dawn
Everything has something for you
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face
Exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off your skin I’d probably find another person
There’s nothing worse than trying to bring yourself on back from the dead
So I advise you: listen to that voice in the back of your head 

It’s like I’m paranoid looking over my back
It’s like a whirlwind inside of my head
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
It’s like a face inside that’s right beneath my skin

It’s like I’m paranoid looking over my back
It’s like a whirlwind inside of my head
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
It’s like a face inside that’s right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
It’s like I’m paranoid
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
Can’t stop what I’m hearing within
It’s like the face inside is right beneath my skin

It’s like I’m paranoid looking over my back
It’s like a whirlwind inside of my head
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
